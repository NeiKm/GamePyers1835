Hello, Team!
To streamline our workflow on this project, we've established a specific file and directory structure. This will help each developer understand where to write code and which files are responsible for what. Here’s a brief guide:

1. Main Directory app/
__init__.py:

This is where our Flask application is initialized.
It’s also where configurations, extensions (like the database), and routes are connected.
Backend Developers: Make changes here if you need to add new configurations or extensions.
routes.py:

This file contains the routes. It defines the URLs and the functions that handle requests to them.
Backend Developers: Create and modify routes here to handle requests and render pages.
models.py (if used):

This file describes the data models that link to the database.
Backend Developers: Add and modify models here if the project uses a database.
forms.py (if used):

This file defines the forms for our application.
Backend Developers: Define the forms that will be used in your routes here.
2. templates/ Directory
This directory contains all the HTML templates that will be displayed to users.
Frontend Developers: Make changes to the HTML templates, add new designs, and link styles and scripts here.
3. static/ Directory
This directory holds all the static files: CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources.
Frontend Developers: Place and modify styles, scripts, and other static files here.
4. run.py
This file is used to run the Flask application.
Backend Developers: Configure application launch settings here if needed.
5. config.py (if used)
This file contains application configurations, such as secret keys, database settings, and other environment variables.
Backend Developers: Modify configurations here if you need to change application behavior.
Summary:
Frontend Developers: Work in the templates/ and static/ directories. All changes related to the user interface and site appearance should be made here.

Backend Developers: Your main workspace is the app/ directory. Add new routes in routes.py, data models in models.py, and forms in forms.py.

This structure is designed to make our work more organized and efficient. If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the structure, feel free to share!

With this text, each team member will know exactly where to work and which files to modify to achieve our project goals.
